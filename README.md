# IveBeenWantingToDoRealTimePredictionOfThingsAsDataIsComingOffTheSequencerSinceBethesda

works best with nanopore but i have no exp in nanopore

so that MARIN paper, they're doing real time classification every ~10 mins of sequencing on the nanopore

ive been fking talking about this in my personal statement for YEARS

now it looks like im trying to copy them, but its been my fking idea since bethesda >:(

its the broad so ive been vindicated that ive always been good enough for this program, this whole entire chaos

that is 100% what im going to be working on, not the only thing, im going to be a leader in this area: rapid REAL TIME classification of things, many things, as data is coming off the sequencer bc now im PISSED

and btw, btw, that is the advantage of changing instutitions, there may be an advantage of sitting at the same place doing the same thing for the past 8 yrs, but theres a better advantage to changing institutions, i learned and relearned so much from all of these places i worked at. way better than working at the same place for the past 8 yrs.

ok so i learned about this, in general, last yr, wont say where but

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coreset this is important for the title of this repos for streaming algorithms, other things too

u know this stuff doesnt exist yett, i mean maybe it does but i dunno, but i want to use coresets
