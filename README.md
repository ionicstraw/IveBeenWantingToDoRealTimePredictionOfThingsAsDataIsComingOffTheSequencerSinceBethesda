# IveBeenWantingToDoRealTimePredictionOfThingsAsDataIsComingOffTheSequencerSinceBethesda

works best with nanopore but i have no exp in nanopore

so that MARIN paper, they're doing real time classification every ~10 mins of sequencing on the nanopore

ive been fking talking about this in my personal statement for YEARS

now it looks like im trying to copy them, but its been my fking idea since bethesda >:(

its the broad so ive been vindicated that ive always been good enough for this program, this whole entire chaos

that is 100% what im going to be working on, not the only thing, im going to be a leader in this area: rapid REAL TIME classification of things, many things, as data is coming off the sequencer bc now im PISSED
